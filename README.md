# Costumer-Segmentation
This project focuses on creating a machine learning model for customer segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm. The objective is to group customers based on the total bytes consumed by their devices, the downlink throughput and other relevant features.

# Project Overview
In this project, we harness the capabilities of K-Means Clustering, a widely used unsupervised learning algorithm, to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their shared characteristics. This approach can provide valuable insights for targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and business strategy optimization.

The project repository includes the following components:

Dataset/: This directory holds the dataset and all features explained in Dataset_Features.txt

Customer_Segmentation.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook used for building and analyzing the segmentation model.
